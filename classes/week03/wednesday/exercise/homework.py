please prepare two questions you may have on the tictactoe lab  --> labs/lab2/Lab 02.pdf 
and or run tictactoe.py in labs/lab2/student_code to see how the game plays -> but come 
up with two questions/

for instance, take a look at play_game.py.  One person could ask why is this line in the code:
sys.stdout.flush()  we haven't seen that before but what do you think it does?

Also, please prepare three questions you have on Python Notes Part 1 or Part 2 (pdfs)
-> week03/

Tic Tac Toe Questions:
    1. What part of the code directs the machine to pick a spot according to the last move by the player 
    2. What does the path function do in the code?
        e.g. base_dir = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
    3. What will default_code in the equation "default_code = base_dir.parent / 'default_code'"

Python Notes Questions:
    1. Example of the math? behind pow() function
    2. Explanation of id() function and what it may be used for?
