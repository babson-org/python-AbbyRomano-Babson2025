    "\n",
    "    You are presented with three closed doors. A car is behind one,   \n",

    "    The host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the other two     \n",

    "    remaining unopened door (Door 2).   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Create simulations where you test both strategies: staying with your  \n",

    "\n",
    "    For instance: suppose you choose door 1 (and door 1 happens to have   \n",
    "    the car behind it).  Monty reveals either  door 2 or door 3  \n",
    "    (assume he selects one with equal probabilities).  In the no switching    \n",
